# Agent Support Matrix

Feature compatibility across supported AI coding agents.

Last updated: 2026-07-11

> **Planned refactor — this matrix is slated to become an interface, not prose.**

> `if (isCodexCommand()) … else if (isGeminiCommand()) …` ladders spread across
> `agents.ts`, `tmux-pty.ts`, `agent-hooks.ts`, and `agent-skills.ts`. The design
> in [decision 124](decisions/124-agent-adapter-interface.md) collapses the
> launch/trust/hooks/skill columns into one `AgentAdapter` per agent (pure
> descriptor + a `src/bun` executor), keyed by base command with an explicit
> `GenericAdapter` fallback. Column → future interface member: *System prompt
> injection / Session resume / Permission mode / Effort / Max budget / Model
> selection* → `launchArgs()`; *Auto-trust worktree* → `trustPatch()`;
> *Status hooks* → `hooksSpec()`; *Skill injection* → `skillBody`. The
> Claude-only rows (*LLM provider*, *Rate-limit tracking*, managed accounts, MCP
> pre-approval) stay outside the seam, keyed by `isClaudeCommand`.

## Status Hooks

Injected per-worktree at task launch.

### Claude Code

Injected into `.claude/settings.local.json`.

| Hook event | Status transition | Purpose |
|------------|------------------|---------|
| `UserPromptSubmit` | → `in-progress` | User sent a message, agent starts working |
| `PreToolUse` | → `in-progress` | Agent is about to call a tool (also catches post-permission resume) |
| `PermissionRequest` | → `user-questions` | Agent needs user approval for a tool call |
| `Stop` | → `review-by-user` | Agent finished its turn |

### Codex

Generated in each task's `.codex/hooks.json` and enabled via `~/.codex/config.toml` (`[features] hooks = true` on Codex 0.129+, `codex_hooks = true` before that). Current Codex deliberately reads project hooks from the root checkout instead of a linked worktree, so dev3 also injects the same definitions as session flags into every Codex pane. On Codex 0.129+, dev3 asks `hooks/list` for authoritative hashes and adds trust state to that session override only; it never changes `~/.codex/hooks.json`, persists hook trust, or trusts unrelated user/project/plugin hooks. The Codex skill forbids duplicate manual normal-lifecycle moves; semantic questions, custom columns, and explicit completion remain manual. `PermissionRequest` runs on Codex 0.122+; older hook parsers ignore that unknown event while retaining the others.

| Hook event | Status transition | Purpose |
|------------|------------------|---------|
| `SessionStart` | → `in-progress` | Marks startup/resume turns as active |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | → `in-progress` | User sent a message, agent starts working |
| `PreToolUse` | → `in-progress` | Agent is about to use Bash, apply a patch, or call an MCP tool |
| `PermissionRequest` | → `user-questions` | Codex is waiting for a tool or network approval |
| `PostToolUse` | → `in-progress` | Clears the waiting state after an approved tool finishes |
| `Stop` | → `review-by-ai` / `review-by-user` | One atomic server-side transition selects the correct review target and returns valid JSON to Codex |

Beyond status, the `SessionStart`/`UserPromptSubmit` hook payloads carry the Codex `session_id` (the resumable rollout id), and the hook process inherits `$TMUX_PANE`. dev3 records that id onto the matching `sessionState` pane so recovery can `codex resume <id>` the exact per-pane session — Codex has no launch-time session-id flag, so this is the only way to target a specific session (see decision 125).

## Skill Differences

### dev3 (task lifecycle)

The dev3 skill (`SKILL.md`) is installed into each agent's skill directory. Three variants exist:

- **Claude variant** — deliberately short: the full protocol body is already injected into the system prompt via `--append-system-prompt`, so `SKILL.md` only auto-sets the status and shows `dev3 current --brief` (via `!` command injection, zero tool calls). The full body is written to `PROTOCOL.md` next to it as a fallback for sessions started outside the dev3 launcher. See decision 114.
- **Codex variant** — full body; hook-aware status section with manual fallback for older sessions, keeps the `/bin/bash` shell note. The same body is also injected out-of-band as a developer message via `-c developer_instructions=...` on every dev3 launch, including scratch tasks and resume (decision 115); the skill file remains the fallback for sessions started outside the dev3 launcher
- **Generic variant** — full body (for Gemini it is the only protocol channel); full manual status management instructions ("CRITICAL — NON-NEGOTIABLE"), requires agents to run `dev3 task move` at start/end of every turn

All variants teach the same two-step dev3 bug-feedback flow: send the private anonymous vent first, then offer to create a public `h0x91b/dev-3.0` GitHub issue with the `Reported by AI` label after explicit user approval. They also treat an unqualified interactive artifact/report/dashboard request as a likely dev3 HTML artifact, while preserving explicit Claude Artifact and build/package meanings, and require agents to copy the task-local starter before editing it.

### dev3-project-config (project configuration)

A supplementary skill that teaches agents about `.dev3/config.json` and `.dev3/config.local.json`. Covers the schema, merge priority, when to create/modify config files, and CLI commands (`dev3 config show`, `dev3 config export`). Same content for all agents (no variant differences).

### dev3-bug-hunter (displayed as "dev3 Bug Hunter")

A user-invocable skill that turns the agent into a seeded bug hunter. It generates a random seed, derives an identity letter, chooses a starting area plus analysis style, and then forces the hunt to begin from that assigned area before branching out. The skill is read-only, uses a terminal-friendly findings format with a compact ASCII summary table plus detail sections, asks whether `critical` and `medium` findings should become separate dev3 tasks, and requires those follow-up tasks to validate and reproduce the bug before any fix is attempted. Same content for all agents.

For Gemini CLI specifically, dev-3.0 installs these managed skills only via the shared `~/.agents/skills/` alias. Gemini also discovers `~/.gemini/skills/`, but duplicating the same skill name in both user-scope directories triggers same-tier conflict warnings and the alias already has precedence.

## LLM provider (per-agent backend)

Each agent can run against its **native API** (default) or a registered
third-party backend (today: **Amazon Bedrock** for Claude), chosen via a
**per-agent** toggle inside that agent's row in **Settings → Coding Agents**
(`CodingAgent.llmProvider` / `CodingAgent.providerConfig`). dev3's built-in
configs select a model with `--model` using native aliases (e.g.
`claude-opus-4-8[1m]`); third-party providers reject those, so when one is
selected dev3 **omits `--model`** for that agent and injects the provider env
instead. Agents on their native provider — and agents with no registered
backend at all (Codex, Gemini, …, which show no toggle) — are unaffected.

Providers are data, not code: each one is a `ProviderDefinition` in the
`PROVIDER_REGISTRY` (`src/shared/llm-provider.ts`), keyed by an `LLM_PROVIDER` id
(`src/shared/types.ts`) and bound to an agent via its `agentCommand`. Adding a
backend = one id + one registry entry + i18n labels; the toggle, env injection,
and model table all read the registry. The toggle only appears on agents that
have ≥1 registered backend.

dev3 injects only the provider's enable flag + the pinned model (merged into the
launch env; a config's own `envVars` still win). **Credentials, AWS
region/profile are NOT set by dev3** — the customer configures those in their own
global agent setup (shell env / `~/.claude/settings.json`).

| Provider | Injected env | Model id source |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Anthropic | _(none)_ | `--model <alias>` as usual |
| Bedrock | `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | alias→`<geo>.anthropic.*` map (geo = `global`/`us`/`eu`/`apac` toggle), or the per-model override |

Known model aliases map to provider-native ids automatically
(`src/shared/llm-provider.ts`); unknown/new models are derived from the alias so
dev3 **always pins the model** (the agent never falls back to a different default
than dev3 expects). The settings model-mapping table is pre-populated and
inline-editable per model (Manual badge + Revert); a geo-aware provider's geo
toggle re-prefixes all non-overridden rows. See [decision 089](decisions/089-llm-provider-toggle.md).
