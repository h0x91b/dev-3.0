# UX Decisions

Append-only log of UX architecture decisions. Each entry: date, decision, rationale, evidence/status.

## 2026-05-29 — Initial manifest derived from repository

- **Decision:** Treat dev-3.0 as a full-screen desktop web app with a **screen-based navigation model** (the `Route` union in `src/mainview/state.ts`), not a URL-routed site. The manifest's "routes" are screen ids.
- **Rationale:** There is no URL router; navigation is `useReducer` + back/forward history. Modeling it as URL routes would be fiction.
- **Status:** `Observed`.

## 2026-05-29 — Button variants documented as role → token, not as a prop

- **Decision:** Document button semantics by semantic role mapped to Tailwind token classes (`bg-accent` = primary, `text-danger`/`bg-danger` = destructive, ghost = hover surface) rather than a `<Button variant>` API.
- **Rationale:** No formal Button component or `variant` prop exists; buttons are styled inline. AGENTS.md forbids hardcoded colors and mandates semantic tokens.
- **Status:** `Observed`.

## 2026-05-29 — Native application menu is the canonical action surface

- **Decision:** Treat the Electrobun application menu (`src/bun/application-menu.ts`) as the authoritative, complete action taxonomy; DOM toolbars mirror only the frequent subset.
- **Rationale:** The native menu enumerates every File/Edit/Task/Project/View/Debug action; DOM surfaces are intentionally partial to control density.
- **Status:** `Observed`.

## 2026-05-29 — Toolbar button creep flagged as the primary anti-pattern

- **Decision:** Set explicit complexity budgets and require an overflow/group decision before adding visible buttons to `TaskInfoPanel`, `TaskCard`, or board toolbars.
- **Rationale:** Changelog history shows a steady accretion of always-visible git/tmux/dev-server buttons; these are the densest, highest-risk surfaces.
- **Status:** `Inferred` (from changelog + file sizes).
